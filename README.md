# Blog
App based on react,The app is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach.
Here I create json server that file pasted in Blog repositories and I host json server locally in our system to store Blog Data 
Firstly go to json-Blog directory in Cmd.Then we need to start json server using json-server --watch Blog.json --port 12345 command line Running the project go to project directory.
run npm to install packages (just a first time).
run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser)

      "content": "What is a VPN:\nVPN is an app that is available for desktop and mobile both. Using VPN you can bypass the Geo-blocks placed by any app. VPN stands for virtual private network, and it is one of the most used types of software on the internet. By using VPN, you hide your internet activity from your internet service provider, and access websites and apps which are usually not allowed in your country. \n\nHow easy or tough it is to use a VPN:\n\nIt is very easy to use a VPN, and for the first time, it might take 3-5 minutes for you to understand how to use a VPN, and then it would be simpler every time.  I have already published a detailed tutorial on how to use NordVPN.\n\nHow does a VPN work:\nNow, before we talk about the best Bybit VPNâ€™s, lets understand how a VPN works. When you use a VPN network, youâ€™re using an encrypted IP address rather than your real IP address. The VPN software that you will use, creates a secure tunnel between your computer and the VPN server which is located outside your geographical location. \n\nYour internet activity is hidden, as all the websites or app that you use will be using a VPN server which is in some other country. One important thing you should know is, you need to manually select the VPN server location every time you enable the VPN software.  However, this process is super simple, and you would realize it when you use any of the VPN software listed in this Bybit VPN guide. ",
